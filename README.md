This is a snake game that I wrote in Python, and the snake is floating in space so I called the game "Space Python". In the game you can play anonymously or create a user. If you create a user you will see you highscores in each difficulty and your average highscore. So it can be a simple fun game where you can compare your highscores with others' scores if you are using your computer with someone else. All the art is done by me as well.

Just run "Space Python.py" and have fun :)

This is how creating, deleting and selecting players look like. Here, you see the players' highscores in each difficulty and an average highscore.

This is how the game looks like:
